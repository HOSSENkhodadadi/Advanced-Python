# 🔥 Advanced Python – The Minimalist GPT-Driven Learning Approach

## ⚠️ STOP Searching Google or Watching Hours of YouTube

You **don’t** need to:
- Spend hours watching YouTube tutorials  
- Google every Python concept  
- Read bloated articles with outdated examples

## 🚀 A New Way to Learn

This repository introduces a **new, interactive way** to master **Advanced Python concepts** by leveraging **ChatGPT** as your personal tutor in a **question-driven** learning loop.

---

## 💡 Learning Methodology

Forget passive learning. Here's the 4-step **active learning loop** that works:

1. 🧠 **Ask ChatGPT to explain** the concept + minimal implementation.
2. 🧪 **Ask ChatGPT to generate an example question** with its correct answer.
3. 🗣️ **Ask ChatGPT to quiz you** and validate your solution.
4. 🔁 **Repeat Step 3** until you fully grasp the topic.

> ✅ After understanding the concept, **don’t look at the implementation immediately** – try to write it **yourself first**, then compare.

## 📂 What’s Inside This Repo?

Each file/folder includes:

- ✅ A **Python concept** (e.g., metaclasses, decorators, generators, context managers, etc.)
- 🤖 A ready-to-copy **ChatGPT query** that follows the method above
- 🧩 A **minimal example** with question + solution for practice

## 📘 Example Structure (e.g., `generators.md`)

```markdown
## Concept: Generators

### GPT Prompt:
"Explain what a generator is in Python, how it works, and give a minimal example."

### Example Q&A:
**Q:** Write a generator that yields the square of numbers from 1 to 5.  
**A:**
```python
def square_gen():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        yield i ** 2
